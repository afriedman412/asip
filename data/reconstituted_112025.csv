9,4,SWEET DEE,"So sign up for the Invigaron system today, and take the first steps toward obtaining financial freedom. Invigaron-- a business opportunity as rare as the albani berries themselves."
9,4,CHARLIE,"- What's happening? You're, like, a berry salesman now or...?"
9,4,CHARLIE,
9,4,SWEET DEE,"No, I'm a distributor, Charlie, for a revolutionary new product that changes lives."
9,4,DENNIS,- Right. Now explain these to me.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Oh, those are my new wrenches. I got those free for sitting through a 20-minute presentation."
9,4,MAC,"Oh, I get it now. It's a scam."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"No, no, no, no, no, it's not a scam at all. I also had reservations in the beginning, but these super berries grow in the Andes mountains, okay? Alpacas can survive entire winters on this shit."
9,4,SWEET DEE,
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, shit! So it's like a super berry, huh?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,Mm-hmm.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Now what kind of superpowers are you talking about? Like, do you survive the winter?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,Great question.
9,4,DENNIS,"So is that the only super power you get, surviving winters? Because I've survived many winters without these berries."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"No, I think I have an answer for all of this stuff, okay? Okay. Charlie, allow me to demonstrate."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, you got a thing here."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Come over here and hold on to these. Now, this machine is gonna measure the level of toxins in your body caused by stress."
9,4,CHARLIE,All right. Where do I put my feet?
9,4,SWEET DEE,Wherever you want.
9,4,CHARLIE,I'm gonna put them on the stool.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Great. It doesn't matter. Okay, here we go. 120, 140, 157. Oh, shit, Charlie. 157?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,
9,4,CHARLIE,Is that bad?
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah, it's not good."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Guys, I got 157."
9,4,DENNIS,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 157 what?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,Units.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Units, dude."
9,4,DENNIS,Units of what?
9,4,SWEET DEE,Units of stress!
9,4,CHARLIE,Ah!
9,4,SWEET DEE,"You're very, very high in your..."
9,4,CHARLIE,That's a lot of units!
9,4,SWEET DEE,"...in your stress unit. But don't even worry, because Invigaron can help you. These berries are chock-full of antioxidants and phytonutrients."
9,4,SWEET DEE,
9,4,SWEET DEE,
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, thank God. All right, I'm sold. I'm in."
9,4,CHARLIE,
9,4,MAC,"Of course you're buying it, because you're as big of an idiot as she is."
9,4,MAC,"You're getting scammed, Dee!"
9,4,SWEET DEE,It's not a scam!
9,4,DENNIS,You walked into a room that you could have walked out of with a free set of golf club but instead you got got.
9,4,MAC,"Hey, I say we get ourselves a new pair of golf clubs, huh?"
9,4,DENNIS,"Yeah, well, we won't get got though."
9,4,DENNIS,"We gonna get. See, Dee, people like us, we don't get got. We go get."
9,4,MAC,That's right. You won't see us getting scammed.
9,4,DENNIS,No way.
9,4,,---
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Hey-oh! All right, Charlie, I signed you up for the gold member starter kit, okay?"
9,4,CHARLIE,Good. Yeah.
9,4,SWEET DEE,Yeah. You know what's in here?
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Two cases of the juice, four packs of the energy gel."
9,4,CHARLIE,Nice.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"There's a box of shake mix, and I think they threw in a bunch of protein..."
9,4,SWEET DEE,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
9,4,SWEET DEE,"What are you doing, Charlie?!"
9,4,CHARLIE,What?
9,4,SWEET DEE,What are you doing?!
9,4,CHARLIE,I'm drinking the berry juice to save my life.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"This is not about berries, all right? You sell it. This is a whole moneymaking system, okay? That's what Invigaron is."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"It's-it's about money, and it's about, you know, ""wealth creation through-through the use of antioxidants, powerful antioxidants."""
9,4,CHARLIE,"Yeah, uh-huh."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"And, you know, we're going to ""redefine success and-and change the world."""
9,4,CHARLIE,"You know what? All those words are, like, stressing me out, Dee. And I can't get more str..."
9,4,CHARLIE,I'm at 157!
9,4,SWEET DEE,I'm gonna be honest. I'm a little confused as well.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Uh, I don't have a firm grasp on exactly how this..."
9,4,CHARLIE,It's confusing stuff.
9,4,SWEET DEE,Where the hell is Frank?
9,4,SWEET DEE,He can help us.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"He's, like, a business genius."
9,4,CHARLIE,"I don't know where he is. He didn't come home this morning. He took off last night. He said he had some dream or something. And, like, he woke up, he's like, ""Ah, Charlie, I got to get to the playground."" And he shot out of here."
9,4,SWEET DEE,Why is he at the playground?
9,4,CHARLIE,I don't know.
9,4,CHARLIE,He told me not to come.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Well, we got to go figure it out. "
9,4,CHARLIE,He can help explain all this.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah, he's good with stuff like this. We're not."
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, all right, let's do it. I'm drinking this one though."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah, but don't open any more."
9,4,,---
9,4,CHARLIE,Frank?
9,4,SWEET DEE,Huh?
9,4,CHARLIE,What is this? You're stuck? Was this your plan?
9,4,FRANK,No.
9,4,CHARLIE,What is this? How did this happen?
9,4,FRANK,"How does anything happen, Charlie? Move past it, will ya?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,I'm afraid that's going to be impossible.
9,4,CHARLIE,Yeah. Where are your clothes? Why are you naked and stuck in a coil? 
9,4,FRANK,Just get me out of here.
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, well, first we should do the thing because.."
9,4,SWEET DEE,Yeah. Charlie and I have a couple of business questions we wanted to ask you first.
9,4,FRANK,"What? Deandra, don't dick around. Get me out of here!"
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Look, I'll be quick, okay? Now, Charlie and I have recently come into a rare business opportunity, and we were hoping you could clear a couple things up for us. Can you look at that?"
9,4,FRANK,It's a pyramid scheme.
9,4,SWEET DEE,It's not a pyramid scheme. It's a reverse funnel system.
9,4,FRANK,Turn it upside down.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, shit!"
9,4,SWEET DEE,Goddamn it! Shit!
9,4,FRANK,"All right, you've been duped, suckers."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"You're the sucker, okay? You're naked and you're stuck in a coil!"
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, calm down, calm down."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Look, Frank is there any way, you know, to get out of one of these schemes?"
9,4,FRANK,"All right, what you got to do is round up a couple of suckers and get 'em hooked. Dummies with deep pockets are the best."
9,4,SWEET DEE, What about Ben the Soldier?
9,4,FRANK,"Well, he's as dumb as you can get."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Yeah. He's dumb as bricks, that guy. He's so stupid."
9,4,FRANK,"All right, let's do it. That's good."
9,4,CHARLIE,"We'll get him, and I'll get, like, a pulley or a rope, and we'll just yank you out of there or something, all right?"
9,4,FRANK,Get me out of here.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah. Hold on, hold on."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Charlie, whoa, think about this. If we get him out of there, how do we know he's gonna keep helping us?"
9,4,CHARLIE,"Well, what do you mean?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,"If we get him out of there, he might scam us further. We don't know. He's a business mastermind. I don't know what he's got going on."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Shit, that's a good point."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"I mean, what's he doing in that coil, you know what I mean? He wouldn't say. He could be up to something. I say we leave him stuck in there just for a few more days so we can leverage him for business advice..."
9,4,CHARLIE,Right. We keep him contained.
9,4,SWEET DEE,That's right.
9,4,CHARLIE,"If we need questions, we just go to him."
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, all right."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Hey, uh, Frank, we'll be back in a couple days to help you out, okay, buddy?"
9,4,FRANK,"No, no, no, no! Deandra, I don't have a couple of days! It's Saturday coming up. There's gonna be kids here!"
9,4,,---
9,4,OTHER,"Hey, guys."
9,4,OTHER,You here for the presentation?
9,4,OTHER,I'm Harris Marder.
9,4,MAC,"Save it, bozo. We're here for the free golf clubs."
9,4,DENNIS,"You got exactly 20 minutes to do your little song and dance. We're just gonna tune out, so why don't you give us a wave when you're finished."
9,4,MAC,Or don't.
9,4,OTHER,What's the point?
9,4,OTHER,"I'd just be wasting my time. I mean, obviously, you two are smart."
9,4,DENNIS,"19 minutes and 50 seconds, clown."
9,4,OTHER,"Don't get me wrong. Invigaron is great, but you got to put in the hours. You fellows strike me more as men of leisure."
9,4,DENNIS,Obviously.
9,4,MAC,"Well, we are."
9,4,OTHER,"Yeah, I mean, this guy's got the Hawaiian shirt, you with the killer tan. Bet it's killing you guys to be stuck indoors on a beautiful day like today."
9,4,MAC,"It is. So less yapping, more golf clubs please."
9,4,OTHER,"Yeah, I get it. And you know what? Because you guys are such great sports, I'm gonna throw in a coupon for a free round of golf at the Dusty Dunes Resort in Orlando. You guys been to Florida?"
9,4,DENNIS,Been there? Not physically.
9,4,OTHER,"If you want, I can set you up with one of their private villas."
9,4,DENNIS,Private villa.
9,4,DENNIS,Whatever. That's pretty nice.
9,4,DENNIS,Look at that.
9,4,MAC,"Oh, it is nice."
9,4,OTHER,"Did you know that the average rate for a hotel room 30 years ago was $19? Today it's $237. That's a 1,300% increase. So it's not inconceivable to think that in another 30 years, a week at a hotel runs you 20 grand."
9,4,MAC,That's not inconceivable.
9,4,DENNIS,"That's... crazy. That's very, very conceivable. Really?"
9,4,OTHER,"Okay, but not for you guys. You'll be locked in at $1,400 annually."
9,4,DENNIS,Wait. We would be?
9,4,OTHER,"Yeah. I'm not talking about taking a vacation, guys. I'm talking about owning a vacation. And, look, if you're still not comfortable with the numbers, you just double down. You get two weeks, sell that second week, boom, you're vacationing for free."
9,4,DENNIS,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
9,4,DENNIS,"Mac, I think this guy just bent himself over a barrel a little bit."
9,4,MAC,He did?
9,4,DENNIS,"Yeah, for our pleasure. Follow me here. Okay, so if we buy a second week, and we sell that, we're vacationing for free. What happens if we buy a third week and sell that? "
9,4,MAC,We're getting paid to vacation!
9,4,OTHER,"You guys, I... I've actually never thought of it like that."
9,4,DENNIS,I know!
9,4,OTHER,I'm not sure I can make that deal.
9,4,MAC,The deal's locked in.
9,4,DENNIS,Deal's done.
9,4,MAC,"I'm gonna write in ""three..."""
9,4,MAC,"Write in ""three weeks."""
9,4,MAC,Three here... that's done!
9,4,,"Yeah, right?"
9,4,DENNIS,Put three on...
9,4,MAC,You got got!
9,4,MAC,"You thought we were a bunch of suckers, but guess what?"
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, God."
9,4,MAC,We're not.
9,4,MAC,We just bought three weeks of a time-share.
9,4,OTHER,So you did.
9,4,,---
9,4,CHARLIE,Not a great turnout.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"No, not-not a great turnout. You know why?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Nobody gives a shit about free soup, Charlie."
9,4,SWEET DEE,People want golf clubs and concert tickets.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Don't knock the soup, all right? Da'Maniac's here."
9,4,CHARLIE,"He's sucked down, like, three bowls of it."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah, he is here. And why is he here, Charlie?"
9,4,CHARLIE,Well...
9,4,SWEET DEE,Nobody wants to buy something from a deranged wrestler. Why would you invite him?
9,4,CHARLIE,I didn't invite him. He just drifted in.
9,4,CHARLIE,I guess he was...
9,4,CHARLIE,Just looking for soup.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"...looking for free soup, yeah, free soup."
9,4,SWEET DEE,All right.
9,4,CHARLIE,"You know, drifters..."
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, let's just get it going, all right?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for coming today. Each one of you has been hand-selected to potentially join our Invigaron team. ""What is Invigaron?"" you may be asking."
9,4,SWEET DEE,Charlie?
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Hello, everyone. I'm Dee, and this is Charlie."
9,4,CHARLIE,"And as you can tell by our huge mansion, we're insanely loaded. "
9,4,SWEET DEE,"But it wasn't always this way. We used to be losers, like all of you people. And then we discovered the Invig..."
9,4,OTHER,Invigaron!
9,4,CHARLIE,And it all starts with the berries. The berries are the most delici...
9,4,SWEET DEE,I'm sure you're all excited to learn more about the Invigaron system.
9,4,CHARLIE,"What the hell happened to my part, Dee?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Yeah, I had to do some reshoots. You are way too hung up on the berries."
9,4,SWEET DEE,The success of the Invigaron system is largely due to the simplicity of its origins. Using a multi-tiered distribu...
9,4,SWEET DEE,...multi-level market...
9,4,SWEET DEE,...the Invigaron system...
9,4,SWEET DEE,...multi-level...
9,4,OTHER,Invig...
9,4,CHARLIE,"I'm Andy, proud owner of my own mountain, where..."
9,4,CHARLIE,Did a couple reshoots of my own.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Proud owner of my own mountain, where I'm a magical bean farmer."
9,4,CHARLIE,Berries!♪
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Does the sophisticated business model of Invigaron confuse you? You don't need to understand how Invigaron works, because somebody above you does. So ask less questions, and make more money."
9,4,SWEET DEE,There we go.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Well, I wasn't quite finished, there's..."
9,4,CHARLIE,Still not convinced?
9,4,CHARLIE,"Well, guess what?"
9,4,CHARLIE,"The Invigaron system is also a pyramid scheme. ""What's a pyramid scheme?"" you ask. "
9,4,FRANK,"All right, basically a house of cards where the dickheads at the bottom do all the work, and give all the money to the smart guys up at the top."
9,4,FRANK,"All right? Now, will you get..."
9,4,CHARLIE,Don't just be successful. Be berry...
9,4,SWEET DEE,You won't need a pot of gold.
9,4,MAC,But still amazingly badass...
9,4,DENNIS,So do...
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, any questions?"
9,4,OTHER,I have a question.
9,4,OTHER,"Uh, how do I get in on this?"
9,4,CHARLIE,"Uh, you probably don't, because you need money."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Ben, how many boxes am I gonna put you down for?"
9,4,OTHER,I don't really understand what I'm buying.
9,4,SWEET DEE,You saw the video. 
9,4,CHARLIE,Was the video not clear?
9,4,SWEET DEE,"The video was pretty clear, Charlie."
9,4,CHARLIE,You think maybe it's your stress?
9,4,CHARLIE,Do you want to check your photon levels?
9,4,SWEET DEE,Oh. Yes.
9,4,OTHER,Yeah.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Yeah, you could be stressed."
9,4,CHARLIE,It... okay.
9,4,CHARLIE,Here you go.
9,4,OTHER,"Uh, where should I put my feet?"
9,4,CHARLIE,"Dee, where do his feet go?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,The feet go wherever. What is it with the feet?
9,4,OTHER,Thank you for this business opportunity. I will not let you down.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"No, no, no, no, no."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Sir, you need to pay for the product, you can't just take it out of here."
9,4,OTHER,Roger!
9,4,OTHER,Roger that.
9,4,SWEET DEE,He's just... he's just leaving the bar.
9,4,CHARLIE,He just stole the berries. That's not g...
9,4,CHARLIE,Oh!
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, 107."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Hey, man, that's pretty good."
9,4,SWEET DEE,What? Don't...
9,4,CHARLIE,Healthy guy over here.
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Charlie, no, that's terrible."
9,4,SWEET DEE,He's very stressed out and he needs to buy the product and eat the berries.
9,4,OTHER,"I-I'm sorry. Um, I don't think this is for me."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Oh, goddamn it!"
9,4,CHARLIE,"If 107's bad, I got to eat more berries."
9,4,SWEET DEE,Stop eating berries! You've had enough berries!
9,4,,---
9,4,MAC,I just don't understand.
9,4,MAC,Is it a sexual thing?
9,4,FRANK,"No, just get me the hell out!"
9,4,FRANK,It doesn't matter!
9,4,DENNIS,Matters to me; I don't think I can move past it.
9,4,MAC,We came here for a reason.
9,4,MAC,"Let's just jump into it, all right?"
9,4,MAC,"Frank, we have a very exciting real estate opportunity for you in sunny Orlando, Florida. Yes."
9,4,DENNIS,How would you like to spend one week out of the year living the high life at your own private villa at the Dusty Dunes Resort?
9,4,FRANK,You guys bought a time-share?
9,4,DENNIS,"Well, yeah."
9,4,FRANK,Yeah. How can you all be so gullible?
9,4,DENNIS,"No, no, no, no."
9,4,MAC,"No, this is different, Frank. This is different."
9,4,DENNIS,Tell him.
9,4,MAC,This asshole tried to sell us one week. We took the prick for three.
9,4,FRANK,You did?
9,4,FRANK,You took him for three weeks?
9,4,MAC,Dennis thought of it.
9,4,FRANK,You think he didn't want to sell you as many weeks as possible?
9,4,DENNIS,"No, I don't think he..."
9,4,MAC,"I told you that might have been a concern, I..."
9,4,DENNIS,"No, I know, but I..."
9,4,MAC,"The whole way over, you said that's..."
9,4,DENNIS,"All right, fine."
9,4,DENNIS,"Well, look, I didn't come here to be criticized by a man stuck in a coil! Are you gonna buy a week or not?"
9,4,FRANK,"No, I'm not that stupid."
9,4,MAC,We don't need this.
9,4,MAC,"We're out of here, Frank."
9,4,DENNIS,Screw you.
9,4,FRANK,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I-I-I can help you."
9,4,DENNIS,Yeah?
9,4,FRANK,I can help you. Yeah.
9,4,DENNIS,Help us how?
9,4,FRANK,I'll give you a premium lead on a deep-pocket dummy.
9,4,MAC,Premium lead?
9,4,DENNIS,That's business talk. We need premium leads.
9,4,MAC,Yeah. Who? 
9,4,FRANK,You promise to get me out of here?
9,4,MAC,"Yeah, yeah, Frank, we promise."
9,4,DENNIS,"What do you think, we're gonna leave you in a coil? Give us a name."
9,4,FRANK,Ben the Soldier.
9,4,FRANK,All right?
9,4,DENNIS,"Ben the Soldier, huh?"
9,4,FRANK,"Well, yeah..."
9,4,DENNIS,That's pretty good.
9,4,MAC,It is?
9,4,DENNIS,"He's very, very dumb."
9,4,DENNIS,"I mean, think about it."
9,4,DENNIS,"He went over there, probably saw some pretty serious carnage."
9,4,DENNIS,"He's gonna have some bad PTSD. If we trigger that, he'll be putty in our hands."
9,4,FRANK,"Right, whatever."
9,4,FRANK,"Okay, get me out of here."
9,4,DENNIS,Nah. Nah. Nah.
9,4,FRANK,"Wait, whoa, whoa. Where you going?"
9,4,MAC,"You just got got, Frank."
9,4,DENNIS,"Uh, you played your hand a little too early, sucker."
9,4,MAC,We'll come back when we need you again.
9,4,MAC,That's called leverage.
9,4,DENNIS,Right.
9,4,MAC,That's business talk.
9,4,DENNIS,"Yeah, thought you were good at that stuff."
9,4,FRANK,The kids are coming! What...
9,4,DENNIS,I know.
9,4,FRANK,The kids! The kids will be here!
9,4,,---
9,4,DENNIS,Now listen.
9,4,DENNIS,"We just need to trigger his PTSD a little bit, all right? Get him all jumbled up. "
9,4,MAC,Couple of sudden movements. Loud noises.
9,4,DENNIS,Exactly.
9,4,OTHER,Hey!
9,4,DENNIS,Ben!
9,4,DENNIS,"It's so good to see you, man. How are you? Come on in."
9,4,DENNIS,"Have a seat on the couch, why don't you?"
9,4,DENNIS,"Oh, my God!"
9,4,OTHER,Hi.
9,4,DENNIS,Da'Maniac.
9,4,OTHER,"Yeah, I know."
9,4,DENNIS,What are you doing here?
9,4,OTHER,"Well, I've come for the presentation."
9,4,OTHER,"Gonna be really cool, huh?"
9,4,MAC,"Oh, it's... it's sort of... geared specifically towards Ben, so..."
9,4,OTHER,"I like him, too."
9,4,OTHER,"He a good guy, huh?"
9,4,OTHER,Nice to see you.
9,4,OTHER,That's good.
9,4,DENNIS,He's coming in.
9,4,OTHER,"Hey, Ben."
9,4,OTHER,How you doing?
9,4,MAC,"All right, let's just, uh..."
9,4,DENNIS,"Okay, uh..."
9,4,DENNIS,"All right, listen, so, Ben..."
9,4,DENNIS,"Um, we would like to offer you a week's stay in our time-share condominium in Florida."
9,4,MAC,It's an amazing property.
9,4,MAC,"I mean, when we first saw it, we were like, ""Boom!"""
9,4,OTHER,"Sometimes, loud noises make the squirrels go in my head, and I-I don't fight in the ring anymore, but I still fight with the demons in Da'Maniac's head."
9,4,DENNIS,"All right, well, we'll-we'll try to be a little bit more sensitive to that."
9,4,MAC,I... Yeah.
9,4,DENNIS,"Um, and we'll keep our voices down from here on out."
9,4,DENNIS,"Yeah. Uh, Ben, should we talk numbers?"
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, I don't know. Um, and it sounds really nice, but I'm not trying to make any business decisions. I have a 107 stress level."
9,4,OTHER,Ooh.
9,4,OTHER,I'm sorry.
9,4,OTHER,I shouldn't be here. I-I have to go.
9,4,DENNIS,"Well, wait, Ben, stop. Ben..."
9,4,MAC,"Don't go, Ben."
9,4,DENNIS,"No, the sunshine state."
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, uh, I'm in."
9,4,DENNIS,"Oh, no. Well, no. See, Maniac, it's very expensive. It's, like, $1,400."
9,4,OTHER,"Sold to the Maniac for $1,400."
9,4,DENNIS,Really?
9,4,OTHER,You know why? 'Cause I can pay you in Invigaron.
9,4,MAC,I don't think you're quite understanding.
9,4,MAC,"Uh, this involves you giving us cash, not a product that we would then sell."
9,4,OTHER,Sure.
9,4,MAC,"See, we need cash money."
9,4,DENNIS,"Oh, you're..."
9,4,OTHER,We're on the same page.
9,4,DENNIS,I don't even understand what he's talking about.
9,4,DENNIS,Yeah. Hold on one second.
9,4,OTHER,"No, take your time."
9,4,DENNIS,"Listen, I think we might have been wrong about Dee and Charlie's little investment."
9,4,DENNIS,"I mean, they're out there moving berries like crazy."
9,4,DENNIS,"If those bozos can do it, think how many you and I can sell."
9,4,MAC,"We could flip 'em, like, ten times over."
9,4,DENNIS,That's what I'm saying.
9,4,DENNIS,So I say we swindle Da'Maniac while we got him here.
9,4,DENNIS,Let's get in on Dee and Charlie's little game.
9,4,MAC,Smart.
9,4,MAC,Pyramid scheme and a time-share?
9,4,MAC,We're diversifying our portfolio.
9,4,DENNIS,That's the thing.
9,4,DENNIS,"Okay, all right. Hey, Maniac?"
9,4,DENNIS,"Hey, you just got yourself a deal."
9,4,OTHER,We're in business together?
9,4,OTHER,That's so cool.
9,4,OTHER,"I'm gonna go grab my stuff, and then, if you wouldn't mind, could you show me which room is mine? I'd like a big room, if you don't mind. We're gonna have so much fun."
9,4,OTHER,Invigaron.
9,4,DENNIS,Uh... is-is he under the impression that our apartment is the time-share?
9,4,MAC,It would appear so.
9,4,DENNIS,"Okay, you know what? We'll deal with that later."
9,4,DENNIS,Let focus on getting Ben to crack.
9,4,,---
9,4,SWEET DEE,"All right, now, between Da'Maniac stealing our berries and these night vision goggles, we're in a bit of a hole, so we got to make this count."
9,4,CHARLIE,Okay. What's the plan exactly?
9,4,SWEET DEE,"We're gonna trigger Ben's PTSD, all right?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,"We bust in like Navy SEALs, zip-tie his hands, bag over his head, and then we bash him till he buys."
9,4,CHARLIE,PTSD-- that's so brilliant.
9,4,CHARLIE,How's Frank come up with that stuff?
9,4,SWEET DEE,What can you say?
9,4,SWEET DEE,He knows business.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Okay, ready?"
9,4,CHARLIE,Locked and loaded?
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Let's go, Charlie."
9,4,CHARLIE,Let's move.
9,4,GANG,"Oh, oh, oh!"
9,4,DENNIS,Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here?
9,4,SWEET DEE,We were gonna try and trigger Ben's PTSD and make him buy our shit.
9,4,MAC,Good luck.
9,4,MAC,We've been at it all night.
9,4,MAC,"We broke in here, looking like Arabs, screaming at him. The guy's rock solid. "
9,4,CHARLIE,Why did you dress him like Ebenezer Scrooge? Yeah.
9,4,MAC,He was actually dressed like at when we got here.
9,4,DENNIS,He's clearly got some issues. I just don't know that PTSD is one of them.
9,4,MAC,"Yeah, we've been watching violent war movies all night to remind him of the carnage that he saw in combat."
9,4,OTHER,"I didn't see any carnage. Um, I actually had a good time during the war. I got to travel the world, uh, try new, exotic cuisines. Well, I'm a computer programmer."
9,4,SWEET DEE,What?!
9,4,SWEET DEE,Goddamn it!
9,4,SWEET DEE,Frank told us this dummy was the key to digging ourselves out of our financial debt.
9,4,MAC,Frank told us the same thing.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Well, that's interesting."
9,4,CHARLIE,"So, we're all here doing this because of Frank."
9,4,CHARLIE,"See, I told you he was up to something."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Hold on a second. Getting all naked and cramming yourself into a coil-- that's a pretty good distraction, right?"
9,4,CHARLIE,Right?
9,4,MAC,"Yeah, and think about it."
9,4,MAC,He didn't tell us why he was in that coil.
9,4,DENNIS,"No, no, no. I just assumed that he went down there to pound off in the nighttime."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Yeah, right, right."
9,4,,"Yeah, me, too. Me, too."
9,4,DENNIS,But now I'm absolutely sure he had an agenda. 
9,4,SWEET DEE,I bet he was never stuck in that coil at all. He's been at the top of the pyramid the whole time just gathering our cash.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, right, right, or at the bottom of the funnel. I'm not sure which way it works."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Bottom of the funnel, top of the-- they're the same thing."
9,4,CHARLIE,"Yeah, well, I bet you when we go down there, he's not even in there, is he?"
9,4,DENNIS,"No. Hell, no, he's not in that coil, but I know exactly where he will be."
9,4,,---
9,4,OTHER,"All right, everyone, we have a new addition to the platinum sales staff, and let me just tell you something. This guy is an absolute dynamo."
9,4,MAC,Scam! This guy's a liar!
9,4,DENNIS,You guys are getting scammed!

9,4,OTHER,"Hey, hey, hey!"
9,4,OTHER,What's going on here?
9,4,MAC,"Well, I'll tell you what's going on."
9,4,MAC,We are saving these people from years of financial rape.
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, hey, if you want out of Invigaron, all you have to do is say so."
9,4,OTHER,Wait.
9,4,SWEET DEE,I do?
9,4,OTHER,"Look, you just, uh, sign this release form, pay a $200 penalty fee, your down line will shift up to me, and then you're free and clear."
9,4,OTHER,That's it? All you got to do is sign the document?
9,4,DENNIS,Can we do that?
9,4,MAC,"Yeah, does that mean we're out of the time-share?"
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, no, no, I'm afraid I can't help you there."
9,4,OTHER,Those contracts are ironclad. I'm just relieved you didn't see the old opt-out clause.
9,4,MAC,Wait a second.
9,4,MAC,He just subtly motioned to this document here-- opt-out.
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, no. Oh, crap, I've said too much."
9,4,DENNIS,"Buyer may opt out of the contract within 72 hours for one-time cancellation fee of only $2,000."
9,4,OTHER,You figured it out.
9,4,DENNIS,"Oh, you fool. I have..."
9,4,MAC,"You didn't think we were gonna see this, but we outsmarted you. Yeah."
9,4,MAC,We're a couple of foxes.
9,4,MAC,"All right, you got got!"
9,4,DENNIS,So suck on that little piece of sweetness.
9,4,OTHER,"You also wrote ""faced"" in the memo. Ha! Nice!"
9,4,OTHER,Should have known better than to get involved with a couple sharks like you two.
9,4,DENNIS,You should have. We're just glad we're out from under Frank.
9,4,OTHER,Who's Frank?
9,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, ""Who's Frank?"" he says."
9,4,CHARLIE,Like he doesn't know.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Come on, everybody."
9,4,CHARLIE,Frank's the guy who's behind all this; Frank is the mastermind in the coil.
9,4,OTHER,I sincerely have no idea what you're talking about.
9,4,DENNIS,"Oh, sure you don't, buddy."
9,4,MAC,He might not 'cause Frank...
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Uh-oh. Oh, shit."
9,4,SWEET DEE,"Oh, you thought we came in mad."
9,4,SWEET DEE,Wait till you see what this monster has to say.
9,4,OTHER,This guy?
9,4,OTHER,What are you talking about? This guy's the best salesman I got.
9,4,CHARLIE,Da'Maniac?
9,4,OTHER,Yeah. He's already got 30 people under him.
9,4,OTHER,I got to thank you all so much for hooking me up with that army guy. I got his whole platoonselling for me.
9,4,SWEET DEE,Wait a sec. Da'Maniac's on my down line.
9,4,,Yup.
9,4,SWEET DEE,I'm rich. I'm rich.
9,4,DENNIS,You got got! You got got!
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, whoa, one second."
9,4,OTHER,"One second, guys. Actually, he's in my down line."
9,4,OTHER,"You just bought out, remember?"
9,4,SWEET DEE,Shoot!
9,4,DENNIS,"No, you... Oh!"
9,4,CHARLIE,This guy's good.
9,4,OTHER,"Oh, yeah. You know, sorry."
9,4,OTHER,"I want to get this stuff done here, and then I'll meet you back at our time-share, huh?"
9,4,CHARLIE,"Now, what's going on there?"
9,4,CHARLIE,"Is he, like, living with you guys, or...?"
9,4,DENNIS,He's... It's-it's a whole thing. Just move past it.
9,4,SWEET DEE,That's a hard thing to move past.
9,4,DENNIS,"Yeah, doesn't know what time-share is."
9,4,CHARLIE,"All right, but hold on a second, hold on a second."
9,4,CHARLIE,Is Frank still the mastermind?
9,4,CHARLIE,I don't get it.
9,4,SWEET DEE,Is he still in the coil?
9,4,DENNIS,"No, he's not still in the coil."
9,4,DENNIS,"Come on, guys, he's definitely still behind this."
9,4,MAC,He's probably down in Orlando enjoying that time-share. He's long gone.
9,4,CHARLIE,"Right. Wherever he is, he's having a real good time."
9,4,FRANK,"Hey! Hey, easy, easy, easy."

1,6,,
1,6,SWEET DEE,Are you alright?
1,6,,
1,6,REBECCA,"Yeah, yeah. I’m okay. I wasn’t really all that close to him, actually. He and my mother had a falling out years ago. I haven’t seen him since I was three years old but he doesn’t have any other family, so the police called me."

1,6,,

1,6,CHARLIE,Not a huge surprise.

1,6,,Sweet Dee and Charlie enter to find an unconscious POP- POP hooked up to every machine possible with an air mask over his face. He looks like he died two months ago.

1,6,SWEET DEE,Oh Jesus.
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,"Dee, relax."

1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,"Well, I’m still growing."

1,6,POP-POP,Do you want some candy?

1,6,POP-POP,Eat the candy.
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,Okay.
1,6,,"He pops some candy into his mouth. It, of course, tastes like peppermint flavored asshole."
1,6,,
1,6,POP-POP,"I knew your sister wouldn’t be able to handle this situation. When she was a little girl, she’d wet herself every time her grandmother touched her."

1,6,,

1,6,POP-POP,"I wanna be buried in my uniform, Dennis. And I don’t trust any of these kikes here to take care of that for me. All of the belongings from that part of my life are in a box at the Roxborough Storage facility. I need you to pick it up and bring it here."
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,"Sure, no problem."
1,6,,

1,6,,
1,6,MAC,Anything.
1,6,,
1,6,REBECCA,"I’m sorta in charge of putting together a memorial service for him. You know, nothing big, just a couple of close friends and family members. But I can’t seem to find anyone else who really knew him that well."
1,6,,
1,6,MAC,"Well, it might be difficult to find-"
1,6,,
1,6,DENNIS,I could rustle up some folks to stop by. He had so many friends around the bar. We could pack that service. They’d be happy to attend.
1,6,,Mac looks to Dennis. Who the fuck is he gonna “rustle up”?

1,6,DENNIS,"I actually have a little something prepared. Mac, do you have something prepared? Oh, no, that’s right. You’re not a very good public speaker."

1,6,,
1,6,MAC,How the hell is this possible?
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,He must’ve escaped after the war and came here. I dunno.
1,6,,
1,6,MAC,Maybe it’s just collectors crap or something.
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,There’s photographs. Look at this!
1,6,,"Charlie hands him a photo. It’s a grainy, black & white but the image is still obvious: A young Pop-Pop (who looks exactly like Dennis) is standing proudly giving the old seig heil to a couple of other German scumbags."

1,6,MAC,Holy shit! He looks exactly like Dennis!
1,6,,

There was this one Christmas Eve, years ago...I was over at his house making him dinner, and we got to chatting about the spirit of giving. And finally I just said to him, “You know what, Lionel? We should go down to the shelter and put that spirit into action.” So we did. We went down to that mission and not only did we feed every last one of those poor, starving, people, but we decided that in the spirit of Christ, we would wash the feet of every man, woman, and child there. It was the greatest day of their lives."

1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,We’ve gotten our hands on a little something here that needs to be in this museum. An important piece of human history.

1,6,,
1,6,MAC,"This is an authentic Nazi officer’s uniform, circa 1942."

1,6,,
1,6,MAC,Let’s just say that it found its way to us and leave it at that.
1,6,,
1,6,CURATOR,"Okay. I find this offensive for so many reasons. First off, I’m guessing you acquired this through illegal means."
1,6,,((MMOORREE))
1,6,,2288..
1,6,,
1,6,CURATOR,"For me to take this from you would be an extension of that. And secondly, that you would expect it would make my day assumes that I’m interested in profiting from the murder of millions of innocent people."
1,6,,
1,6,MAC,How much will you give us for it?
1,6,,
1,6,CURATOR,Nothing.
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,Nothing?
1,6,,
1,6,CURATOR,That’s right. We’re not in the business of black market memorabilia acquisitions.
1,6,,
1,6,MAC,"Well, maybe we’ll take this to other museums and see what they think."
1,6,,
1,6,CURATOR,That would not be a good idea.
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,Why not?
1,6,,
1,6,CURATOR,Because I plan to call the police the minute you guys leave my office.
1,6,,The negotiation is not going well. Mac and Charlie look to each other.

1,6,MAC,Could you give us a sec?
1,6,,Mac and Charlie turn around and speak in whispers.

1,6,,
1,6,MAC,Maybe we’ll burn this shit. What do you think about that?

1,6,,"Sweet Dee is in a panic. He rubs his hands all over her face, brushing back her hair. She throws up a little in her mouth. She tries to pull away."

1,6,,He puts his fingers in her mouth. She breaks free.

1,6,,
1,6,MAC,I guess. It just seems like a shame.
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,"Well, if we sell it there’s a chance we go to jail. If we give it away, then we get nothing anything, so we may as well burn it. It’s always fun to burn things."
1,6,,3311..
1,6,,
1,6,MAC,"That’s true. And we should really keep this whole thing from Dennis, anyway, right? I mean there’s no reason to tell him about his grandfather. He hates the guy anyway and it might just screw with his head to find out the truth."
1,6,,
1,6,CHARLIE,I agree.
1,6,,Charlie lights a match and throws it on the box. It burns.

3,4,MAC,"I’m finding this whole thing a bit confusing, Frank."
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,"Mac, just hand me the walkie-talkie."
3,4,,FADE IN:
3,4,,INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY (DAY 1)
3,4,,Frank is hanging out of an air duct in the ceiling.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Why did you hide your will in the ceiling?
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,I didn’t. Charlie did.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Okay. Why did Charlie hide your will in the ceiling.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Because I didn’t wanna crawl around in these goddamn vents. Gimme my guns.
3,4,,Mac pulls out Frank’s gun.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Right. I wanted to talk to you about this. I don’t think you should be walking around with this thing anymore. It always gets you into trouble.
3,4,,22..
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,It recently occurred to me that Dennis and Dee stand to lose a lot of money now that they’re not my kids. They might try to rub me out.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"I think you’re being a bit paranoid here, buddy. You could just go to a lawyer and--"
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Don’t over think this. It makes sense. Gimme the gun.
3,4,,Mac hands him the gun.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Alright.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,It’s dark up here. You sure you can make sense of Charlie’s map?
3,4,,Mac opens a map which looks to have been drawn by a child.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Frank, I understand the subtleties of Charlie’s illiteracy better than anyone. I can guide you right to it."
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Then you shall be handsomely rewarded.
3,4,,They hear a noise from out in the bar.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Shit. They’re here. Seal me up.
3,4,,"Mac does. INT. PADDY’S - SAME (DAY 1) Dennis, Charlie and Dee enter."
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,You’re not the boss of me.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Uh, excuse me, I’m your big brother."
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Where is this coming from?
3,4,,33..
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Well, last night Frank was mumbling your names in his sleep. Talking about his rotten kids this and rotten kids that, and it dawned on me. If Frank is my dad your dad that makes me your brother and in turn, your boss so go get me a beer before I give you a serious noogie."
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,"Dude, if you try and give me a noogie, I swear to god, I will yank your underwear over your head so hard your ass hole will rip in half."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Noogies and atomic wedgies... I mean, if this isn’t little brother, big brother behavior, then I don’t know what is."
3,4,,Mac walks out from the office.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Hey-O. What’s up, bitches?"
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Hey, Mac, can an asshole really rip in half?"
3,4,,"The front door opens. Suddenly, three MEN IN SKI MASKS rush through the door, carrying duffle bags."
3,4,,
3,4,MAN IN SKI MASK,Are they behind us?!
3,4,,
3,4,MAN IN SKI MASK #2,Yeah!
3,4,,
3,4,MAN IN SKI MASK,"Quick, block up the windows!"
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Whoa, whoa! What’s going on?!"
3,4,,They pull out shotguns.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Oh shit!
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Don’t shoot! Take what you want!
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Take the cash register!
3,4,,44..
3,4,DENNIS,
3,4,,Take the girl.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,What?! What do you mean take the girl?!
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,"Dee, don’t argue! Just go!"
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"He’s right, sis. You better go with them!"
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,They’re not trying to take me anywhere!
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Don’t try to be a hero! Just do what they say, Dee!"
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,They haven’t said anything!
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Sis, if you keep arguing with them, we’re all gonna die!"
3,4,,Two of the ski mask guys run around blocking up the windows. One stares menacingly.
3,4,,
3,4,MAN IN SKI MASK #2,We don’t want the girl.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Then take the cash!
3,4,,
3,4,MAN IN SKI MASK #2,We don’t want the cash.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,What the hell do you want?
3,4,,The three walk to the front of the gang. They remove their ski masks. It’s: The MCPOYLES (with sister).

3,4,,INT. PADDY’S - LATER (DAY 1)
3,4,,Liam is on the bar phone. Some time has passed.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"Yeah, that’s right. A gassed up boat. One hundred thousand clams in a briefcase. And a Planet Hollywood jacket. One of those reversible, leather ones."
3,4,,The gang is busy barricading up the front windows.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Is this really happening?
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Taken hostage by McPoyles. It’s pathetic. We should just bum-rush them.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"Hey! I’m the one making the demands here, pig! And if I don’t get these demands met in one hour I am going to kill one of the hostages!"
3,4,,He slams down the phone and walks to the gang.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"You hear that? In one hour, I’m going to have Margaret shoot one of you in the face. If any of you tries to escape we will torture and execute you. Then we’ll massacre the rest in a blaze of glory."
3,4,,He walks off.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Shit. I think he means it.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,He’s never gonna get those demands.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,There’s no way they’re going to get a Planet Hollywood jacket. Those places don’t even exist anymore.
3,4,,77..
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,"Guys, this is serious. We have to stick together. We need to be careful about Stockholm Syndrome."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Stockholm Syndrome? Does that start with a sore throat? Because my throat is killing me. I think I may be getting it.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,"No, you’re not, Charlie."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"I’m sorry, Dee, but are you a doctor? I don’t think you’re qualified to tell me whether or not I’m coming down with Stockholm Syndrome."
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,No. Stockholm Syndrome messes with your mind. You empathize then start to side with the people taking you hostage. We could end up turning on each other.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Dee is right. We need to watch out for each other. The only way we’re gonna get through this is if we stick together. Nobody has to die.
3,4,,INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY 1)
3,4,,Dennis has pulled Dee into the bathroom.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Somebody has to die.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Right.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,It doesn’t have to be one of us.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,We have the most to live for.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,"I mean, I don’t want anybody to die, but if it’s gotta be somebody, it may as well be Mac or Charlie. What do they have to live for?"
3,4,,88..
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Nothing.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Okay. Then we need to make a pact. No matter what happens you and I have to stick together.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Then we can subtly shift attention away from us and onto those guys. We’ll make an alliance.
3,4,,INT. PADDY’S - LATER (DAY 1)
3,4,,Dee has pulled Charlie aside.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Dennis is gonna try to have you killed.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,I can’t say that surprises me.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,He’s gonna sell us all down the river.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,You think we should take him out?
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,"Look, I don’t want anybody to die. All I’m saying is that if somebody has to die, it may as well be Dennis."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,He’s had a full life. It’s been a good ride.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,A great ride.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,I’ve had a terrible ride.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,You’ve had the worst ride. You deserve to have another shot at the ride. So no matter what happens you and I need to stick together.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Okay. What about Mac? We gotta get to him before Dennis does.
3,4,,99..
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Mac will be with us.
3,4,,INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BAR - LATER (DAY 1)
3,4,,Mac is crouching down. Talking into the radio.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Frank. Come in Frank. The McPoyle’s have taken us hostage and they’re gonna kill everybody. It’s too late for them. Climb down that vent and come get me outta here.
3,4,,INTERCUT WITH:
3,4,,INT. AIR DUCT - SAME (DAY 1)
3,4,,"Frank is crammed into a dark, tight air shaft. He’s using a lighter for illumination a la John McClane."
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,"Jesus Christ, where have you been? I’ve been calling you for the past twenty minutes. I’m lost up here."
3,4,,MAC
3,4,,The McPoyles have taken over the bar. They’re threatening to kill one of us. Come save me.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Shit.
3,4,,Frank thinks a second.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,I know. Come save me.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Not until I get that will. I’ll help you after I get the will safe and secure.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Can’t we do that some other time?
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,This is even more of a reason to get that document. Who knows how this thing’s gonna shake out. You help me. I’ll help you.
3,4,,1100..
3,4,,INT. PADDY’S PUB - SAME (DAY 1)

3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Gotta go. I’ll call you back.
3,4,,Mac switches off the walkie and gets up.
3,4,,INT. PADDY’S - MOMENTS LATER (DAY 1)
3,4,,Liam addresses the gang who are lined up side by side.
3,4,,LIAM
3,4,,"Alright, everybody, listen up. There’s no way they’re gonna be able to meet our demands. The next phase of our plan shall be executed."
3,4,,Charlie pushes Dee out in front.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Make it quick.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"No. It’s only been ten minutes, Charlie."
3,4,,Dee walks back in line.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,"Okay, buddy. Is that how we’re gonna play? No problem."
3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,We’re gonna have to create an escape route.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,You guys are gonna dig a hole that goes straight through to the building next door. Then we’ll go up to the roof and make our escape by helicopter.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Why don’t you just blast your way out the front door and use Charlie as a human shield?
3,4,,1111..
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Why should I be the human shield? Mac should be the shield. He’s widest.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,I am most certainly not an adequate shield. Dee would make the best human shield and everybody knows it.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,True. Dee’s got the most square footage out of all of us. She’d make the best shield.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,It’s a no brainer. I vote Dee.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,I second it.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,"Then it’s settled. Dee’s the human shield. Thanks for risking your life, sis. We’ll never forget you."
3,4,,Ryan points the shotgun at the gang.
3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,You’re digging a hole.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"Here’s how we’re gonna do this. Two of you will dig, while two of you rest, and then you’ll switch."
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,I volunteer to rest first.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Bullshit. You can’t volunteer to rest.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,You can be on my dig team if you want. Either way my team rests first. I called it.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Then it’s settled. I’m on your team. We’ll rest while Charlie and Mac dig.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"You’re teaming up with Dee instead of me? Some loyalty, bro."
3,4,,1122..
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"You don’t want to be on my dig team, Mac?"
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Easy, buddy. I never said that. The syndrome’s making you all paranoid."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Sorry, man. You’re right. You know... I’m feeling dizzy, too."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Maybe you should sit down.
3,4,,"Look, guys, Charlie’s coming down with a nasty case of Stockholm Syndrome. And I don’t think you wanna room full of sick hostages. Our team should rest first."
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Fine. Whatever. Dennis and Dee are digging first.
3,4,,You guys go rest up in the bathroom.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Nice. You mind if I grab a couple of beers? I think we’ll feel a lot more relaxed if we can have some beers back there.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Maybe I should get a cooler with some ice.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Good idea.
3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,No.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Come on man. Use your head. How are we gonna keep the beers cold without a cooler?
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Charlie’s right. You gotta have the cooler.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,I agree. All in favor.
3,4,,"Mac, Dennis, Dee, Charlie and Margaret raise their hands."
3,4,,1133..
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,"Great, then it’s settled. Charlie go get a cooler."
3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,"Don’t move, Charlie! No beer! No cooler! Margaret put your hand down."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Your sister agrees with us.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,She’s deaf and mute. She only raised her hand because you guys did.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Really? Let’s try it again.
3,4,,They all raise their hands. Margaret does the same.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Well that’s fascinating.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Really cool.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,I wonder what else we could get her to do.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Let’s all blink really fast.
3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,Everybody put your hands down! Stop blinking! Leave Margaret alone!
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,You two are in the bathroom.
3,4,LIAM,"You two grab some shovels. Ryan, crank the heat all the way up. We’re gonna make this place hot and clammy, just the way the McPoyles like it."
3,4,,CUT TO:
3,4,,INT. THE VENTS - SAME (DAY 1)
3,4,,Frank finds some writing on one of the vents.
3,4,,1144..
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Here we go. Charlie what are you trying to tell me?
3,4,,He reads.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,“If here by now then bad place be. Trouble time for you when heat comes.” Jesus Christ the kid’s an idiot.
3,4,,A loud burst of air shoots through the vents. The ducts shudder and rock. Frank is blasted with wind.
3,4,,
3,4,FRANK,Oh shit.
3,4,,INT. BATHROOM - LATER (DAY 1)
3,4,,Charlie covers his mouth with his hand as he talks to Mac. Margaret stands guard.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,I think I need to get to a hospital before this syndrome gets any worse.
3,4,,
3,4,,Why are you covering your mouth?
3,4,MAC,CHARLIE
3,4,,So she won’t know what we’re saying. She can read lips.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"No way, dude. This chick cannot read lips. I’ll show you."
3,4,,Mac looks right at Margaret.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Do you know what I’m saying? Can you make out any of these words? You can’t read lips, can you?"
3,4,,Margaret responds by quickly licking her top lip.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Right.
3,4,,Mac pulls out the map.
3,4,,1155..
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Okay, Charlie. We need to talk. You gotta help me read this map. It looks like a game of Pictionary."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,What are you doing with my map?
3,4,,MAC
3,4,,"Frank gave it to me. He’s up in the vents trying to retrieve his will. Now, I need to guide him to the will so that he’ll give me a percentage of the inheritance. See, he wants to destroy it because..."
3,4,,"Charlie rolls his fingers, making the universal sign for “speed it up”."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"...he thinks Dennis and Dee might kill him so they can get their money earlier. He feels like if he... look, man, I’m explaining as fast as I can."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"It’s just so boring. I’m falling asleep here, bro."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Well, you should be interested in what I’m saying because if Dennis and Dee are no longer in the will, then this could be really good for you."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Continue.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Can I do it at a reasonable rate or do I have to keep talking fast for your unbelievably small attention span?
3,4,,Charlie checks his imaginary watch.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"You’re losing me, here."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Okay fine.
3,4,,"Think about it, Charlie. You’re Frank’s only biological child. If there’s no will and he dies, you automatically get all the money!"
3,4,,1166..
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Okay. I like where you’re heading with that part.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Great. Then hurry up and read this map so Frank can destroy the will.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, the map you’re holding is fake. It’s a decoy."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Nice. Good thinking. Where’s the real map?
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,The real map... is tattooed on my body.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,No way. Let me see it.
3,4,,Charlie turns around and drops his pants.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Dude, what are you doing? Pull your pants back up."
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"I told you, the map is on my body."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Um, where exactly on your body is it? I don’t see it."
3,4,,Charlie bends over.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,You can’t be serious.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,I’m dead serious.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,This isn’t possible.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Oh, it’s possible."
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Dude, I’m not looking in your butt."
3,4,,1177..
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Do you want Frank to find the will or not?
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Fine. But you have to swear that you will never tell anyone about this.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,I swear.
3,4,,Mac crouches and looks at Charlie’s butt. Margaret watches with baited breath.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,I don’t see anything.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,Look closer.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Stop clenching.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Okay, just look closer."
3,4,,
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,What do you see?
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Nothing.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,...What do you smell?
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,"Goddamnit, Charlie! What is wrong with you? Why would you do that to me?"
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,To teach you a lesson. Don’t hold back information from me anymore.
3,4,,
3,4,MAC,Just shut up and give me the real map.
3,4,,
3,4,CHARLIE,"Oh yeah, you’re holding it. There’s no fake map. That’s the only map."

3,4,,Dennis and Dee have ripped out the booths and now stand with sledgehammers and shovels. They’re dripping with sweat.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,This is unbearable. I feel really woozy...
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,How could anyone like it this hot?
3,4,,Liam approaches with two glasses of milk.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Two glasses. Luke warm. Skim for the lady.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,We don’t want your milk. What the hell did you guys do anyway? Why are the cops after you?
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Robbed a bank.
3,4,,
3,4,DEE,Where’s the money?
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,In the get-away car.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Where’s the get-away car?
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Outside with the cops. Now start smashing that wall. Post Haste or else.
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Or else what? I think you guys are full of shit.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Is that right?
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,Yeah that’s right. I think I’m gonna walk out that front door right now and you’re not gonna do anything because I don’t think you’re serious.
3,4,,1199..
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,You don’t think I’m serious?
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,No.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,You think I’m bluffing?
3,4,,
3,4,DENNIS,I think you’re bluffing.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Does this look like I’m bluffing? Ryan stab somebody
3,4,,
3,4,,"Out of nowhere, Ryan comes running up with a large BOWIE KNIFE and slices the shit out of Liam’s arm."
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"Ahh!! Goddamnit, Ryan! What are you doing?"
3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,You wanted me to show them that we’re not bluffing.

3,4,,
3,4,RYAN,Oh sorry.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,Good Lord! Hand me that milk.
3,4,,Dee hands him one of the glasses of milk. Liam pours the milk on his arm.
3,4,,
3,4,LIAM,"Alright, I gotta go deal with this."

1,7,,
1,7,MAC,I was with those guys! The cops are asking for more people to come forward! That means there are more guys out there who’ve been blown.

1,7,DENNIS,Go in there? You can’t just thrust yourself into the position of caregiver like that.

1,7,SWEET DEE,"Dennis, please, I’m the one that actually majored in psyche. You can keep words like “caregiver” to yourself. I’m not impressed."
1,7,,

1,7,,
1,7,SWEET DEE,Why?
1,7,,
1,7,MAC,"He was a little psychopath. He had this thing when he got all excited, his face would turn purple and he’d just start biting things. I doubt anyone would’ve put their dick anywhere near him."

And sometimes we'd be out at a mall or a stadium or whatever and I'd have to use the bathroom, but my mom wouldn’t let me use the men’s all by myself so she’d carry around a dress for me to wear so I could follow her into the ladies’ room and now I’ve been doing it for so many years that I guess I’m just more comfortable pooping this way. Whatever, I guess I identify as a woman when I’m pooping. It’s not that weird."

13,6,MAC,But I’m gay! That’s a minority.
13,6,DENNIS,Are you more gay than you are Catholic?
13,6,MAC,I don’t know. They’re at war.
13,6,,Mac hands Frank back his phone.
13,6,CHARLIE,What does it say about transgenders?
13,6,FRANK,Less than 1 percent.
13,6,CHARLIE,Right. So that would make me...
13,6,DENNIS,The minority.
13,6,,
13,6,CHARLIE,Right. And that would mean...
13,6,,
13,6,DENNIS,You explain it to him. Because I can’t.
13,6,,
13,6,FRANK,It means you get the good bathroom.
13,6,CHARLIE,Awesome!
13,6,DENNIS,"All those in favor of doing the actual right thing, and giving the real minorities the good bathroom?"
13,6,,"Charlie, Dennis, and Frank all raise their hands. Mac and Dee begrudgingly join them."
13,6,DENNIS,It’s unanimous. White non-Christian men get the good bathroom.
13,6,FRANK,At last.
13,6,CHARLIE,So that’s it? We can go to Buffett now?
13,6,DENNIS,"Yes we can. And if we hurry up, we can still fit in a little tailgating."
13,6,FRANK,I’1l bring the grill. Who wants cheeseburgers?
13,6,,They head toward the door. But Mac and Dee DON’T MOVE.
13,6,SWEET DEE,We're not going.
13,6,DENNIS,What?
13,6,MAC,"You used Buffett’s words to promote discrimination, dude. That’s not right."
13,6,DENNIS,But you have to go! You two are the only other real Parrotheads of the bunch.
13,6,DENNIS,
13,6,,
13,6,DENNIS,Frank’s only there for the chicks and Charlie doesn’t even know the songs!
13,6,CHARLIE,Hey! I know the songs.
13,6,CHARLIE,"Aruba, Jamaica, oh I want to take ya--"
13,6,DENNIS,That's Beach Boys! That’s the Beach Boys!
13,6,FRANK,He’s right. There’s no point in going to Buffett if we don’t all go together.
13,6,SWEET DEE,Then I guess we’re not going to Buffett.
13,6,,A SOMBER SILENCE as this realization sinks in.
13,6,,TITLE: “ONE HOUR TO BUFFETT...”

13,6,,"The Gang sits at the bar, drinking. The good vibes of the Cold Open are gone. After a sad moment:"
13,6,CHARLIE,
13,6,CHARLIE,If you like pina coladas...
13,6,,
13,6,DENNIS,"Please, Charlie. It’s too painful."
13,6,,
13,6,CHARLIE,But you said it’s not Buffett.
13,6,,
13,6,DENNIS,It’s close enough.
13,6,MAC,Have you guys ever listened to the lyrics of that song? It’s super dark.
13,6,,
13,6,SWEET DEE,What?
13,6,MAC,"Yeah. It’s about a guy trying to cheat on his wife. The song starts “I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long.”"
13,6,,
13,6,CHARLIE,"{ Really? It seems like such a happy song. - I mean, who doesn’t like pina coladas?"
13,6,,
13,6,,
13,6,SWEET DEE,"Uh, I don’t. As a woman on-the-go, I can’t waste precious time waiting for my drink to thaw."
13,6,DENNIS,"See, as a straight man, I enjoy pifia coladas. But I hate getting caught in the rain. It flattens my hair and you all know how good I look in leather."
13,6,,They agree. He does.
13,6,FRANK,"How about making love at midnight? As a senior citizen, I can’t get it up past six, six-thirty."
13,6,CHARLIE,"Well, as a straight man who poops transgender, I don’t have any desire to go to Aruba or Jamaica for that matter."
13,6,,
13,6,,
13,6,DEE/DENNIS,"That’s not a thing, right?/Never was./Not the song."
13,6,MAC,I guess when you get right down to it we all identify very different... out here. But you know what? We’re not so different...
13,6,,He points to the bathrooms.
13,6,,
13,6,MAC,...in there. In there we’re all the same.
13,6,,
13,6,DENNIS,"Yeah, behind those doors we’re all disgusting. Vulnerable. Ashamed."
13,6,,
13,6,FRANK,Like a bunch of filthy animals dumping in a shithouse.
13,6,,
13,6,MAC,We're all animals. It’s the only common thread between a peasant and a king. Everyone has to shit.
13,6,CHARLIE,"We've been trying to make everyone comfortable in that shithouse, but the truth is, whatever your identity is, no one is ever, ever comfortable shitting next to someone else."
13,6,FRANK,"But if everyone is going to be uncomfortable sharing the bathroom, then how can we solve the problem?"
13,6,SWEET DEE,"Well, I guess the only thing we can do is... recognize that in there we’re all the same and that we should just treat other people how we’d like to be treated."
13,6,,This last part BLOWS EVERYONE AWAY.
13,6,MAC,"Whoa, Dee."
13,6,FRANK,Did you just make that up?
13,6,SWEET DEE,Yeah. I guess I did.
13,6,CHARLIE,Is that in the Constitution?
13,6,SWEET DEE,"It feels like it should be, right?"
13,6,DENNIS,"Hey, guys. I think I might have a solution to our bathroom problem."

13,6,MAC,That’s it!
13,6,,
13,6,CHARLIE,Can’t argue with that.
13,6,FRANK,We did it.
13,6,SWEET DEE,"Hey, if we hurry, we can still make it to Buffett!"
